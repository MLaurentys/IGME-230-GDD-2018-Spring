# HW - Create a 230 home page

## I. Overview
For this assignment you will create a personal 230 "home page" where you will be able to post links to the projects you will complete for this course. For those of you have not touched HTML & CSS since taking IGME-110, it will also function as a refresher on how to create a basic Web page, a directory (folder) structure, and post files to a Web server.

## II. Requirements
* The page will be named index.html
* The page will be located at `http://people.rit.edu/yourid/230/`

Your page's design is up to you, but it needs to contain the following elements:
* A level-1 heading that reads "YOUR NAME's 230 Page" (replacing "YOUR NAME" with your own name, obviously)
* A **recognizable** photo of yourself (not the back of your head, not a drawing, not you wearing a mask)
* A brief bio about yourself (a paragaph will do), telling me about your interests and your goals; what do you hope to get out of the class, your major, your time at RIT, and where do you want to be when you graduate?
* Placeholder links to the following:
  - Each of the 3 class projects
* A link to your GitHub repo for this class
* A pleasing (or at least tolerable) color scheme and layout, using your [CRAP](http://www.presentationzen.com/chapter6_spread.pdf) principles and other design guidelines
* You should use an *external CSS* file for all of your styles.
* Your CSS should include at least 2 ID selector and 2 class selectors
* You must also change all the anchors on your page to match your color scheme (changing all four states)
* Your page needs to pass W3C [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validation
  - In order to pass and be legible, you also need to *fix Banjo* (i.e. turn off ModPagespeed). If you don't do this, you will lose points on **every** assignment.
