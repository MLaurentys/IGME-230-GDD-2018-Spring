# 3 - Canvas & ES6 Classes

## Overview
In the last chapter we utilized **prototype-based inheritance** (and factory functions,  object literals and `Object.create()`) to create an inheritance-like hierarchy of sprite objects.

In this chapter we will utilize ES6 class syntax to more or less do the same thing.

**Note: If you need a refresher on JavaScript ES6 classes, please read the first 3 sections of his tutorial page: [ES6 Classes & PixiJS Animation](pixi-js-2.md)**

From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes

**JavaScript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are *primarily syntactical sugar* over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. The class syntax does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript.**

By "syntatical sugar" we mean that behind the scenes, ES6 class syntax merely re-creates what we did in the last section using prototypical inheritance and `Object.create()`
