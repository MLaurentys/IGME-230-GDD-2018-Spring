# Introduction to Web Applications

## What is a "Web App"?

The wikipedia definition - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application - is pretty good - "A web app is a clientâ€“server computer program in which the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, online auctions, wikis, instant messaging services and many other functions."

In this course we are going to create some simple web apps that run in modern web browsers. 
The examples we will build include a calculator, an image gallery, an app that can search/download/play song previews from a music service, and simple games.
Most of these apps will run entirely in the *client* (i.e. the web browser). Others (the music player) will utilize data downloaded from the Internet. 

## What's in a web browser?

If we are going to build applications that run in web browsers, we need to understand the major components of the browser that can be scripted by us.

1. The **Web Layout Engine** - each browser has a layout engine that renders (draws) marked up content by utilizing formatting information. We have already been doing this with HTML (a markup language that adds structure and meaning to the content on our web pages) and CSS (a presentational language that adds colors, fonts, spacing, etc).
Each major web browser has its own layout engine: Chrome and Opera have *Blink*, Safari has *WebKit*, FireFox has *Gecko*, and Edge has *EdgeHTML*. There are subtle differences between these engines, and they adopt new and experimental features at different times, but the distinctions between them have been lessening over time.

You can read more about layout engines here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser_engine

1. The **JavaScript Engine** - this is a program that executes JavaScript code in the web browser. Each browser vendor has their own distinct engine: Chrome has V8, Safari has Nitro (JavaScriptCore), and FireFox has SpiderMonkey. These engines have performance differences and differing support for newer JavaScript language features.

1. **Web Browser APIs** - API stands for "Application Programming Interface" and reflects what a web browser can *do*. JavaScript would not be very useful thing in a web browser if not for the various APIs that are available in today's web browsers. These APIs include the ability to select and modify HTML elements on the page, to play audio and video, to do procedural drawing, to store application data locally (in the web browser), to send and receive files from remote servers, and more.

A mostly complete list of browser APIs can be found here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API

Here is a list of some common Web APIs that you will be using in this course and the following web course (IGME-330):
- **Canvas** - procedural drawing and animation -  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API
- **Document Object Model (DOM)** - used to access and modify the contents and style  of a web page - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model
- **Fetch** and **XMLHttpRequest** - used to fetch resources over a network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API & https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest
- **Web Storage** - store key/value pairs of data in the user's browser - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API
- **Web Audio** - analyze and add effects to audio such as reverb and panning, or create periodic waveforms from scratch using `OscillatorNode` - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API


## How do I know what browser APIs I can use in my web applications?
This can be a challenge because the various web browser vendors adopt new features a different times. 
Sometimes new features are adopted long after standards bodies have approved them, other times browser vendors will implement experimental features prior to a standard being agreed upon.

### The main standards bodies are here:
- World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/
- Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) - https://spec.whatwg.org

### The Mozilla Foundation probably has the best and most complete set of web API documentation:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide

### Learn about what the browser vendors are up to here:
- https://www.chromium.org/blink
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko
- https://webkit.org
- https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/
