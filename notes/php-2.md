## I. <a id="section1">PHP Types

- PHP has 4 *scalar* (i.e. "primitive") types: integer, float (aka double), string and boolean
- PHP has 2 *composite* types: array and object
- PHP has 2 *special* types: resource and null

## II. <a id="section2">PHP Variables
- variables in PHP are denoted with a leading dollar sign `$`
- variables can, but do not need, to be declared before assignment
- variables do not have intrinsic *types* - a variable does not know in advance whether it will be used to store a number or a string
- PHP does a good job of automatically converting types from one to another when necessary.
