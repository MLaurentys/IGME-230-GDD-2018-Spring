# About this Web App Tutorial Series
## I. Overview
This series of tutorials will get you started in creating web applications, which are *client-server* applications in which the client code runs in a web browser. 

## II. Prerequisite knowledge
- The HTML/CSS which we covered in this class
- CSS selectors (in particular the CSS3 selectors) will come in handy
- Fundamental programming concepts that you gleaned from the (at least) 2 programming classes you have taken prior to this course.

## III. The Tutorials
1. [Introduction to Web Applications](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-GDD-2017-Fall/blob/master/notes/web-apps-1.md):
    1. what is a web app?
    1. what components of the web browser can I program?
    1. what are web standards?
1. [Introduction to JavaScript](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-GDD-2017-Fall/blob/master/notes/web-apps-2.md)
    1. a brief history of JavaScript
    1. variables, constants, and types
    1. running code in the JavaScript console
    1. viewing error messages in the JavaScript console
    1. common built-in JavaScript objects
1. [Introduction to the Web Browser DOM](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-GDD-2017-Fall/blob/master/notes/web-apps-3.md)
    1. did the HTML elements on the page load?
    1. selecting elements on a web page
    1. modifying elements on a web page
    1. add elements to a page, primarily with `.innerHTML`
    1. viewing the "live" DOM tree with the web inspector
    1. using the JavaScript debugger to "break on exceptions"
    1. adding code breakpoints in the JavaScript debugger
    1. viewing the value of variables in the JavaScript debugger
1. [More Web Browser DOM Methods](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-GDD-2017-Fall/blob/master/notes/web-apps-4.md)
    1. the DOM inverted tree
    1. relationships: parent, child & sibling
    1. creating and modifying DOM elements
    1. inserting and deleting DOM elements from the DOM tree
1. JavaScript Functions
1. JavaScript Events
1. JavaScript Arrays
1. JavaScript Object Literals & ES6 Classes
1. The WebStorage API
1. Intro to Web Services

## IV. What has been left out of this series
This course is an introduction to web publishing and scripting the browser. Later courses with go deeper and cover more topics, and there is very much more that that to learn about web applications on your own. Here are some major topics that we are NOT covering:

- **Advanced JavaScript Concepts** will continue to be covered in downstream courses.
- **Canvas API** is covered in IGME-330.
- **Cloud Computing** is the practice of using a network of **remote servers** hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data. 
While we are going to utilize Internet resources in the form of web services, in this course our application code will be 100% on the client machine (the web browser). 
In later courses (IGME-330 & IGME-430) you will get the opportunity to read/write data to "the cloud", and even have application logic running on remote servers.
- **Database/Data Modeling** - creating a key:value server utilizing Node.js is covered in IGME-430 (an elective), *Data Modeling* and the SQL language are covered in ISTE-230 (an elective)
- **Web Games** will be covered later in this course, and we will build several games or interactive experiences using the Pixi.js rendering engine.
