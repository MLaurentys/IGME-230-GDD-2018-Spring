# About this Web App Tutorial Series
## I. Overview
This series of tutorials will get you started in creating web applications, which are *client-server* applications in which the client code runs in a web browser. 

## II. The Tutorials

## III. What has been left out

- **Cloud Computing** is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. 
While we are alter going to utilize Internet resources in the form of web services, in this course our application code will be 100% on the client machine (the web browser). 
In later courses (IGME-330 & IGME-430) you will get the opportunity to read/write data to "the cloud", and even have application logic running on remote servers.
- **Games** will be covered later in this course, and we will build several games or interactive experiences using the Pixi.js rendering engine.
