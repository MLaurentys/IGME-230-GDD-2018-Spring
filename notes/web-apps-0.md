# About this Web App Tutorial Series
## I. Overview
This series of tutorials will get you started in creating web applications, which are *client-server* applications in which the client code runs in a web browser. 

## II. The Tutorials
1. [Introduction to Web Applications](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-GDD-2017-Fall/blob/master/notes/web-apps-1.md):
  a. what is a web app?
  b. what components of the web browser can I program?
  c. what are web standards?
1. [Introduction to JavaScript](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-GDD-2017-Fall/blob/master/notes/web-apps-2.md)
1. [Introduction to the Web Browser DOM](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-GDD-2017-Fall/blob/master/notes/web-apps-3.md)
1. [More Web Browser DOM Methods](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-GDD-2017-Fall/blob/master/notes/web-apps-4.md)
1. JavaScript Functions
1. JavaScript Events
1. JavaScript Arrays
1. The WebStorage API

## III. What has been left out
This course is an introduction to web publishing and scripting the browser. Later courses with go deeper and cover more topics, and there is very much more to learn about web applications on your own. Here are some majot topics that we are NOT covering:

- **Advanced JavaScript Concepts** will continue to be covered in downstream courses.
- **Cloud Computing** is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. 
While we are alter going to utilize Internet resources in the form of web services, in this course our application code will be 100% on the client machine (the web browser). 
In later courses (IGME-330 & IGME-430) you will get the opportunity to read/write data to "the cloud", and even have application logic running on remote servers.
- **Database/Data Modeling**
- **Web Games** will be covered later in this course, and we will build several games or interactive experiences using the Pixi.js rendering engine.
