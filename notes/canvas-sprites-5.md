# 5 - JavaScript & the ES5 Module Pattern

## Overview
- In the last chapter we looked at how easy it is to utilize ES6 module syntax to create loosely coupled and highly maintainable code.
- The only issue with ES6 modules? They are supported only on recent versions of the major browsers.
- In this chapter, we will look at creating modular code using the *Revealing Module Pattern* - which is a popular technique for achieving modularity in pre-ES6 browsers. You can read about this pattern and others here:
