# Instructor Notes

## Week 0
- in mycourses:
    - create gradebook, give everyone 100% (5/5) in attendance
    - post link to syllabus and schedule to mycourses welcome page
    - add a "links" module (i.e. folder) to the Content section, and add a hypertext link (that opens in a new window) to [schedule.md](../schedule.md)
    - email students welcoming them to the class, and send them the link to the course github repo, as well as the [Week 1A: Course Introduction](../weekly/Week-01A-notes.md) - request that they read this page and the [syllabus](syllabus.md) prior to attending class.
- set up mycourses dropboxes for:
  - [Custom 404 Authorization ICE](../exercises/week-1/Custom_404_Auth_start.zip)
  - [PHP-1](php-1.md)
  - [HW: php.ini](HW-php-ini.md)
  - [PHP-2](php-2.md)
  - [PHP-3](php-3.md)
  - [HW: PHP "Fact of the Day"](HW-php-fact-of-the-day.md)

## Week 1
### Day 1 - there is quite a bit to do today!
- introduce self and TA
- show the course link in mycourses, and the already extant mycourses dropboxes. **Reminder:** all code files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) must be zipped when put in a dropbox, because otherwise mycourses strips out the JavaScript and CSS, and you will likely get a zero on the assignment.
- "Welcome to course"
- review [syllabus.md](../syllabus.md)
- review [schedule.md](../schedule.md)
- Review [Week 1A: Course Introduction](../weekly/Week-01A-notes.md)
    - there is a lot here, you don't need to read it verbatim, the instructor will summarize it, and the students are expected to read it themselves
    - review what the course is about, and show a few examples of previous projects 
    - cover pedagogy and emphasize there will be many (small) HW assignments, so keep an eye on the dropboxes!
    - review [http-protocol-intro.md](http-protocol-intro.md), discuss what a web server is, how you can program it (which we will do with .htaccess files next time, and PHP next week)
    - do the [http-protocol-demo.md](http-protocol-demo.md), highlight the request line, headers, and request/response, and then answer the review questions on the bottom of [http-protocol-intro.md](http-protocol-intro.md) together.
- time allowing, create a *hello.html* page and post it to banjo (some students might have forgotten the FTP and permissions part of posting to banjo)

### Day 2 
- "Anyone here who wasn't here last time?"
- "Any questions from last time?"
- recap HTTP protocol stuff from last time
- Review [Week 1B - Review of banjo.rit.edu & FTP](../weekly/Week-01B-notes.md)
   - review *hello.html* and FTP (FileZilla or similar)
   - do .htaccess presentation
   - show a page like this one - https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/ - that `ModPagespeed` is compressing the styles and JS
   - use the Chrome web inspector to show headers - including the `ModPagespeed` header
   - walk through the [Fixing Banjo Exercise](../exercises/week-1/Fixing-Banjo.md) and then check the inspector to see that the `ModPagespeed` header is gone, and check the page to see that the styles and JS are no longer compressed 
   - let the students work on the [Auth and htaccess PDF](../docs/Auth_and_htaccess.pdf) exercise
