## Week 1
## Day 1 - there is quite a bit to do today!
- "Welcome to course"
- review [syllabus.md](syllabus.md)
- review [schedule.md](schedule.md)
- Review [Week 1A: Course Introduction](../weekly/Week-01A-notes.md)
    - here is a lot here, you don't need to read it verbatim, just summarize it and encourage the students to read it themselves
    - talk about what the course is about, and show a few examples of previous projects 
    - cover pedagogy and emphasize there will be many (small) HW assignments, so keep an eye on the dropboxes!
    - review [http-protocol-intro.md](http-protocol-intro.md), discuss what a web server is, how you can program it (which we will do with .htaccess files next time, and PHP next week), do the [http-protocol-demo.md](http-protocol-demo.md), and answer the review questions on the bottom of [http-protocol-intro.md](http-protocol-intro.md) together.
- time allowing, create a *hello.html* page and post it to banjo (some students might have forgotten the FTP and permissions part of posting to banjo)

## Day 2 
- Review [Week 1B - Review of banjo.rit.edu & FTP](../weekly/Week-01B-notes.md)
