# About this Canvas Sprites Tutorial Series
## I. Overview
This series of tutorials/lecture notes will get you started creating canvas sprites for your Audio Visualizer and Game Assignments for IGME-330.

## II. How to get the most out of these tutorials
- Try out the code samples! Tweak and modify them! Most of the code samples are 100% complete. You just need to copy the code and paste it into a text file, and save them to a web server. You can then make changes to the code and preview them in a web browser (we will be using Chrome)
- Be sure to answer all of the questions at the end of each section, and to do the review exercises.

## III. The Tutorials
1. [Intro to Canvas Sprites](./canvas-sprites-1.md)
    - Canvas animation without objects
    - Sprites via JS Object literals
    - Create multiple objects with a "factory function"
1. [`Object.create()` & Delegation](./canvas-sprites-2.md)
    - JavaScript does not have classes
    - Prototype-based inheritance and the "prototype chain"
    - extending behavior - delegation
    - overriding behavior - shadowing
    - `Object.create()` & `Object.assign()`
    - `CircleSprite`, `SquareSprite`, `ImageSprite`
1. [PHP Arrays](./canvas-sprites-3.md)
    - Indexed and associative arrays
    - Looping though arrays
    - Array functions
    - The `$_SERVER` "super global"
