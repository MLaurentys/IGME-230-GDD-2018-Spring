# About this Canvas Sprites Tutorial Series (IGME-330)
## I. Overview
This series of tutorials/lecture notes will get you started creating canvas sprites for your *Project 1 : Audio Visualizer* and *Project 2: Game or Experience*  assignments for IGME-330.

## II. How to get the most out of these tutorials
- Try out the code samples! Tweak and modify them! Most of the code samples are 100% complete. You just need to copy the code and paste it into a text file, and save them to a web server. You can then make changes to the code and preview them in a web browser (we will be using Chrome)
- Be sure to answer all of the questions at the end of each section, and to do the review exercises.

## III. The Tutorials
1. [Intro to Canvas Sprites](./canvas-sprites-1.md)
    - Canvas animation without objects
    - Sprites via JS Object literals
    - Create multiple objects with a "factory function"
1. [`Object.create()` & Delegation](./canvas-sprites-2.md)
    - JavaScript does not have classes
    - Prototype-based inheritance and the "prototype chain"
    - extending behavior - delegation
    - overriding behavior - shadowing
    - OLOO - "Objects linked to other objects"
    - `Object.create()` & `Object.assign()`
    - `CircleSprite`, `SquareSprite`, `ImageSprite`
1. [Canvas & ES6 Classes](./canvas-sprites-3.md)
    - ES6 Classes are "syntactic sugar"
    - ES6 Inheritance
    - Side-by-side look at ES6 classes and `Object.create()`:
        - you get nearly the same thing back from the JS runtime!
