Week 10

This week, we will be looking over the [Adventure Game](../notes/HW-adventure.md) example, which contains some cool stuff and might be a good starting point for some of your projects. In particular, this exercise covers:

- Tiling sprites in the DOM
- Keyboard controls
- Audio
- Arrays and game objects
