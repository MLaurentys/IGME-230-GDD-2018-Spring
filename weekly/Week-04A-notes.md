# Week 4A - Basic CSS Layouts

## Topics
- Finish Reviewing the CSS topics from [Week 3B](Week-03B-notes.md)
- Holmes Demo/ICE
    - Start files are here: 
    - Review box model: border, margin, padding

## Review and Demo
Together, we will build a page demonstrating tables, the different types of positioning, as well as embedding fonts, all using an external CSS file. The table tags to note are:
```
<table>
<th>
<tr>
<td>
the colspan attribute
the border-collapse:collapse CSS selector and value, which removes the border space between table cells
```

## CSS Positioning
There's a lot of contention in the Web world on how to position and control elements on a page. The most common approaches now are to utilize floats, margins, and flexible elements (sized in % or a similar relative measurement). However, understanding and applying more precise positioning is very useful when we get to DOM manipulation!
