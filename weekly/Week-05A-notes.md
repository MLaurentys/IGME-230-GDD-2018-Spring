# Week 5A - CSS Wrapup

## Topics
- Navigation
- HTML lists
- More CSS layout
- Font embedding
- CSS Animations
- Standards

## Web Fonts
- What is the difference between serif and sans-serif fonts?
- What are decorative fonts and what are they good for?
- Which is generally more legible on-screen? (Hint: it's not serif)
- We will discuss how to embed fonts and where to find them. There are many resources online for getting them, including Google Fonts (most of which are kind of boring), [1001FreeFonts](https://www.1001freefonts.com/), [DaFont](http://www.dafont.com/), [FontSquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/), and more. It’s important to note that any font you embed is freely able to be downloaded by anyone else who visits your site, meaning you need to have the rights to use the font on the Web (i.e., it needs to be licensed as “free for commercial use”). Any font repo will give its rights. All the fonts on FontSquirrel are licensed in this way.
- I strongly recommend you also use the "Webfont Generator" on FontSquirrel, which will generate the code and files necessary to embed a font (I've had issues, even following the W3C instructions, getting it to work by hand, so I always just use their tool).
